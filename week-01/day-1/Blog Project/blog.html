                <h2>It's my life</h2>
                <p>his ain't a song for the broken-hearted No silent prayer for the faith-departed I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd 
                    You're gonna hear my voice When I shout it out loud It's my life It's now or never I ain't gonna live forever I just want to live while 
                    I'm alive (It's my life) My heart is like an open highway Like Frankie said, "I did it my way." I just wanna live while I'm alive 
                    It's my life This is for the ones who stood their ground For Tommy and Gina who never backed down Tomorrow's getting harder make no mistake 
                    Luck ain't even lucky Got to make your own breaks It's my life And it's now or never I ain't gonna live forever I just want to live while 
                    I'm alive (It's my life) My heart is like an open highway Like Frankie said, "I did it my way." I just want to live while I'm alive 
                    'Cause it's my life Better stand tall when they're calling you out Don't bend, don't break, baby, don't back down</p>
